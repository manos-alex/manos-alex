# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexander Manos, I am studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Connecticut. I am currently looking for Summer 2024 internship opportunities. I am proficient in many coding languages including, but not limited to, Python, Java, and C.

# Projects
## [Circlegame](https://github.com/circlegame)
Circlegame is a 2D aim-train style video game coded in Java. This was my first big project that I had used to test my coding skills. I developed it from scratch using the visual library [Processing](https://processing.org/). After a few months, I began collaborating with [josef-karpinski](https://github.com/josef-karpinski), leading to further development and more creative features. This collaboration helped build my communcation skills, and the overall project had built my foundation of problem solving within programming. Along with Circlegame, we also created its own webpage using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

## [Mandlebrot Set Visualizer](https://github.com/manos-alex/Mandlebrot-set-Visualizer)
This project renders an image of the Mandlebrot Set fractal and allows you to pan and zoom infinitely. I made this project to test my skills that I had learned from my data structures class. I had implemented the program using different structures and approaches to make it run most efficiently. This had helped solidify my understanding of data structures and recursion as well as a higher understanding of Java.
